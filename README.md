**How Atypical Datapoints Influence Off-Policy Evaluation Estimates**

This repository includes the programming portion of the final project, also uploaded to Gradescope via a .zip file.

*OPE_bootstrap_experiment.ipynb*: Contains experiments corresponding to a simple MDP.

*CS184 ASSISTment Data Preprocessing.ipynb*: Contains the preprocessing of the ASSISTment Dataset used for the more complex MDP, as well as the experiments run on that dataset.

Both are intended to be opened and run in Google Colab, although locally via jupyterlab should work as well.
